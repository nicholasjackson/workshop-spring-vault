# Testing the application

Now that everything is configured, let's run the application locally and see if it can connect to the database.

Run the following URL to start the application:

```shell
./gradlew bootRun
```

All being well you will not see any errors and the spring boot application will start.
Let's test the application by inserting a record into the `payments` table.

Run the following command in the terminal:

```shell 
curl localhost:8080/paymentcard  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "user_id": 123, 
        "name": "Mr Nicholas Jackson", 
        "number": "12313434", 
        "expiry":"01/23", 
        "cv3": "1231"
      }'
```

You should see the record ID returned in the response.

## Checking the data

Let's now check the data in the database to see if the record was inserted.

First you need to get some access credentials, you can do this you can do this by running the following command:

```shell
vault read database/creds/reader
```

Then you can use the credentials to connect to the database:

```shell
psql -h postgres.container.local.jmpd.in -U <username> payments
```

When prompted enter your password.
