# Testing the application

Now that everything is configured, let's run the application locally and see if it can connect to the database.

Run the following URL to start the application:

```shell
gradle bootRun
```

All being well you will not see any errors and the spring boot application will start.
Let's test the application by inserting a record into the `payments` table.

Run the following command in the terminal:

```shell 
curl localhost:8080/paymentcard  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "user_id": 123, 
        "name": "Mr Nicholas Jackson", 
        "number": "12313434", 
        "expiry":"01/23", 
        "cv3": "1231"
      }'
```

You should see the record ID returned in the response.

## Checking the data

Let's now check the data in the database to see if the record was inserted.

First you need to get some access credentials using the `reader` role 
and you can use the `psql` command to query the database.


<p>
<details>
  <summary style=\{{ fontSize: '18px', color: 'rgb(84, 128, 178)', fontWeight: 'medium' }} >Hint: commands</summary>

```shell
vault read database/creds/reader
```

Then you can use the credentials to connect to the database:

```shell
psql -h postgres.container.local.jmpd.in -U <username> payments
```

When prompted enter your password.

</details>
</p>

Once you have logged in, query the payments table to see the record you have just added.

```shell
psql (15.6 (Debian 15.6-0+deb12u1), server 15.4 (Debian 15.4-2.pgdg120+1))
Type "help" for help.

payments=> select * from payment_card;
```

What you should see is the record that you have just inserted, but, there is a problem
the card number is stored in plain text.

```shell
payments=> select * from payment_card;
 id | user_id |        name         |  number  | expiry | cv3  
----+---------+---------------------+----------+--------+------
  1 |     123 | Mr Nicholas Jackson | 12313434 | 01/23  | 1231
(1 row)
```

Let's see how we can use Vault to change that.
