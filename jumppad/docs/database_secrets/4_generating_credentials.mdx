# Generate dynamic credentials

Finally you can generate dynamic credentials for the `writer` role. The credentials are valid for the duration 
specified in the role configuration. It is also possible to override the TTL when generating the 
credentials but you can only reduce the TTL, you cannot increase it.

### Run the following command in the terminal to generate some credentials for the `writer` role

```shell
vault read database/creds/writer
```

```shell
Key                Value
---                -----
lease_id           database/creds/writer/SS984TnCX78jOybQqmbfA0of
lease_duration     1h
lease_renewable    true
password           bmuHZS30NsoV3-OUUSLr
username           v-root-writer-79lX9T2hIoauvVJUOla7-1716724716
```

## Use the credentials to access the database

The database details are as follows:

|              |                |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| **Host**     | {{db_address}} |
| **Port**     | 5432           |
| **Database** | payments       |

Use the `psql` command to log into the database using the credentials you have
just created.

<p>
<details>
  <summary style=\{{ fontSize: '18px', color: 'rgb(84, 128, 178)', fontWeight: 'medium' }} >Solution: command</summary>

```shell
psql -h {{db_address}} -U <user> <database>
```

e.g.

```shell
psql -h 10.100.0.180 -U v-root-writer-aVVXa0qoZnjZpDjhRIds-1717007642 payments
```

</details>
</p>

Next execute the following query to select the records from the payments table:

```shell
select * from payment_card
```

You should see the record you just inserted, however, there is a small issue, the card number
has been stored in plain text, this is a security risk and should be encrypted. We will address this in the next section.

```shell
payments-> ;
 id | user_id |        name         |  number  | expiry | cv3  
----+---------+---------------------+----------+--------+------
  1 |     123 | Mr Nicholas Jackson | 12313434 | 01/23  | 1231
(1 rows)

payments=> 
```

Now that you have database access configured, let's look at how we can transparently encrypt data
in the database.
