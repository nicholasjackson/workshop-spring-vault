# Configuring the database connection

Once an engine has been enabled at a given path, you can configure it. The configuration options will vary depending on the type of secrets engine. The database secrets engine requires connection information to the database.

There are many different databases that are supported by Vault [database secrets engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/databases/index.html). When configuring the database secrets engine, you need to specify the plugin name, the connection URL, and the allowed roles.

We will configure the database secrets engine for a PostgreSQL database. The connection URL should be in the format:
 
```
postgresql://\{{username}}:\{{password}}@hostname:port/database_name?sslmode=disable
```

`username` and `password` are template variables, the actual username and password are passed as parameters.


### Run the following command in the terminal to configure the database connection:

```shell
vault write database/config/payments \
    plugin_name=postgresql-database-plugin \
    allowed_roles=writer,reader \
    connection_url="postgresql://\{{username}}:\{{password}}@{{db_address}}:5432/payments?sslmode=disable" \
    username="postgres" \
    password="password"
```

## Rotating the Root Database Credentials

Once you have configured the username and password in Vault it is not possible to read this configuration and retrieve them, 
they are only used internally when generating dynamic credentials. 
However, to configure Vault we had to provide the root database credentials. Regardless of how you obtained these credentisls, 
it is a good practice to rotate them to ensure that they do not leak. Vault can automatically rotate the credentials for you 
without you needing to configure the secrets engine again.

### Run the following command in the terminal to rotate the root credentials:

```shell
vault write -force database/rotate-root/payments
```

Now the Vault has been configured with the database details, let's see how you can create roles
that grant specific permissions.
