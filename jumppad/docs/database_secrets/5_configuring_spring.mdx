# Configuring Spring Boot

Before we can use the dynamic credentials generated by Vault, we need to integrate Vault with our Spring Boot application. We will use the [Spring Cloud Vault](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/reference/html/) library to integrate Vault with our Spring Boot application.

The first step is to configure the `application.yaml` file to connect to Vault. Add the following configuration to the `src/main/resources/application.yaml` file:

```yaml
spring.cloud.vault:
  host: {{vault_addr}}
  scheme: http
  port: 8200
  fail-fast: true
  authentication: TOKEN
  token: {{vault_token}}
```

This configuration is fine for development and does not have any authentication configured.
We are going to use the vault token that is already present on the machine. And we are only
using a local vault cluster.

If you do not have a local Vault cluster but a remote one, spring will automatically pick
up the credentials from the default location when you login using the `vault login` command.
You could also configure some specific authantication like we will see later with Kubernetes.

Next let's configure spring to automatically retrieve the database credentials from Vault
when it starts.
