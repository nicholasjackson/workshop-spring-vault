# Controlling access to Vault using policy

Policies are used to control access to Vault.  A policy is a HCL file that defines
the paths that a token can access and the operations that can be performed on those
paths.  For example the following policy allows access to create a dynamic 
database credential using the `writer` role and to encrypt data using the transit engine.

```javascript
path "database/creds/writer" {
  capabilities = ["read", "create"]
}

path "transit/encrypt/payments" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
```

Let's add this policy to the Vault server. The Vault CLI took has a command called 
`vault policy` this allows you to read / write and list policy.

### Using the `vault policy` command write the above policy to a policy called `payments`

Did you figure it out? If not the solution is below.

```bash
vault policy write payments - <<EOF
path "database/creds/writer" {
  capabilities = ["read", "create"]
}

path "transit/encrypt/payments" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
EOF
```

Now let's see how you link this policy to a Kubernetes service account with a 
role.
