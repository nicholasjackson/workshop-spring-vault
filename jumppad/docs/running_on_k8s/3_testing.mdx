# Testing the application

Let's deploy your application to Kubernetes.

Run the following command in your termainal to deploy the application:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/app.yaml
```

Assuming all went well you should see the following output when you
run `kubectl get pods`:

```bash
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
vault-agent-injector-7d45d84c9d-9bg6b   1/1     Running   0          3h5m
vault-0                                 1/1     Running   0          3h5m
payments-5b859f9556-4wz78               1/1     Running   0          111m
```

## Curl the application endpoint

Let's test that the application is working correctly by submitting a new payment card.

```shell
curl localhost:8081/paymentcard  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "user_id": 123, 
        "name": "Mr Nicholas Jackson", 
        "number": "12313434", 
        "expiry":"01/23", 
        "cv3": "1231"
      }'
```

You should see the record ID returned in the response.

## Checking the data

Let's now check the data in the database to see if the record was inserted.

First you need to get some access credentials, you can do this you can do this by running the following command:

```shell
vault read database/creds/reader
```

Then you can use the credentials to connect to the database:

```shell
psql -h postgres.container.local.jmpd.in -U <username> payments
```

When prompted enter your password.

Once you have authenticated you can again query the payments_card table to see the record you just inserted.

```shell
select * from payment_card;
```

You will see that the card number has been encrypted, this is because the `encryptDataBeforeSave` method was called before the record was saved to the database.

```shell
 id | user_id |        name         |                          number                           | expiry | cv3  
----+---------+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+--------+------
  1 |     123 | Mr Nicholas Jackson | vault:v1:YeLEwWM0ojHqWRXvo0UVr/8PGCrLwqJWgZCvAtMU5rEgyrqA | 01/23  | 1231
(1 row)

payments=> 
```

## Summary

Congratulations, you have successfully deployed an application to Kubernetes that interacts with Vault to secure sensitive data. You have also tested the application to ensure that it is working correctly.

That is all for this workshop, feel free to explore some other features of Vault
and try to implement them into your application.
