# Creating Roles to associate policies with Kubernetes service accounts 

Once you have defined the policies that you want to use you need to create a role
that associates the policy with a Kubernetes service account.  The following command
creates a role called `payments` that associates the `payments` policy with the
`payments` service account in the `default` namespace.

### Run the following command

```bash
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/payments \
  bound_service_account_names=payments-auth \
  bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
  token_policies=runtime
  ttl=24h
```

Now everything has been configured, let's create a new Kubernetes deployment
that uses the `payments` service account to authenticate to Vault and runs
the application.
