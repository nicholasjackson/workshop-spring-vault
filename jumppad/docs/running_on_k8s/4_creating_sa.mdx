# Defining a Kuberentes service account

Now Vault has been configured you need to create a Kubernetes deployment that
will run your application.

The first step is to create a service account for the application.  This service
account will be used to authenticate to Vault.

### Add the following to the file `./k8s/app.yaml':

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: payments
automountServiceAccountToken: false
```

Next let's define a service so we can access our application.
