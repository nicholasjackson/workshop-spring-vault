# Defining a service

Next you need to define a service that will be used to access the application.

### Add the following to the file `./k8s/app.yaml':

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: payments
spec:
  selector:
    app: payments
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8081
      targetPort: 8080
```

Next let's see how we can define an application.yaml that works with kubenetes
authentication.
