#  Adding the deployment

Finally you need to add the deployment that will run the application.
This deployment is pretty standard. It adds the service account that you
created earlier and mounts the application configuration as a volume.

When the application starts it will read the configuration from the
`application.yml` file that is mounted as a volume.  Spring will then attempt
to load the service account token that it expects to be mounted at 
`/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.  It uses this token
along with the role to authenticate with Vault and return a token that can
be used to access the secrets.

### Add the following to the file `./k8s/app.yaml':

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: payments
  name: payments 
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: payments
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: payments
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: payments 
      automountServiceAccountToken: true
      containers:
        - image: nicholasjackson/spring-vault-example:v0.0.3
          name: payments
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config-volume
              mountPath: /config
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: payments-config
```

With everything in place you can now deploy the application to Kubernetes.
