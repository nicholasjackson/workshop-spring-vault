# Configuring Vault

In previous exercises you have been interacting with Vault using an admin token.
When running on a Kubernetes cluster you need to ensuret that the application
has been configured with the correct permissions to interact with Vault.

To secure access to it's API Vault uses a system of policies and roles. Policies
define what paths a token can access and what operations can be performed on those
paths. Roles define what policies are associated with an authentication endpoint.

Previously you authenticated with an existing token, this capability is not
practical in a production environment as it would require long lived tokens
to be deployed with each deployment.  To address this Vault provides the concept
of authentication endpoints.  These are endpoints that can be used to authenticate
to Vault using a known secret such as a Kubernetes service account token, a GitHub
token or a username and password.

The authentication method for Kubernetes has already been configured for your
cluster.  For your information the command looks like this:

```bash
vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
  token_reviewer_jwt=<service account token> \
  kubernetes_host="https://kubernetes.default.svc:443" \
  kubernetes_ca_cert=<kubernetes ca cert>
```

Besides checking that the service account token has been correctly signed, 
Vault uses the Kubernetes API to validate that the presented service account token 
is valid.  For this reason the `kubernetes_host` and `kubernetes_ca_cert` are required
when configuring the Kubernetes authentication method.

## Controlling access to Vault using Policy

Policies are used to control access to Vault.  A policy is a HCL file that defines
the paths that a token can access and the operations that can be performed on those
paths.  For example the following policy allows access to create a dynamic 
database credential using the `writer` role and to encrypt data using the transit engine.

```javascript
path "database/creds/writer" {
  capabilities = ["read", "create"]
}

path "transit/encrypt/payments" {
  capabilities = ["create"]
}
```

Let's add this policy to the Vault server. Run the following command in your
terminal to create a policy called `payments`:

```bash
vault policy write payments - <<EOF
path "database/creds/writer" {
  capabilities = ["read", "create"]
}

path "transit/encrypt/payments" {
  capabilities = ["create"]
}
EOF
```

## Creating Roles to associate Policies with Kubernetes Service Accounts 

Once you have defined the policies that you want to use you need to create a role
that associates the policy with a Kubernetes service account.  The following command
creates a role called `payments` that associates the `payments` policy with the
`payments` service account in the `default` namespace.

```bash
vault write auth/kubernetes/role/payments \
  bound_service_account_names=payments-auth \
  bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
  token_policies=runtime
  ttl=24h
```

Now everything has been configured, let's create a new Kubernetes deployment
that uses the `payments` service account to authenticate to Vault and runs
the application.
