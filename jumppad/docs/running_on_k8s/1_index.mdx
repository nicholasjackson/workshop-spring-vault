# Configuring Kubernetes authentication

In previous exercises you have been interacting with Vault using an admin token.
When running on a Kubernetes cluster you need to ensuret that the application
has been configured with the correct permissions to interact with Vault.

To secure access to it's API Vault uses a system of policies and roles. Policies
define what paths a token can access and what operations can be performed on those
paths. Roles define what policies are associated with an authentication endpoint.

Previously you authenticated with an existing token, this capability is not
practical in a production environment as it would require long lived tokens
to be deployed with each deployment.  To address this Vault provides the concept
of authentication endpoints.  These are endpoints that can be used to authenticate
to Vault using a known secret such as a Kubernetes service account token, a GitHub
token or a username and password.

The authentication method for Kubernetes has already been configured for your
cluster.  For your information the command looks like this:

```bash
vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
  token_reviewer_jwt=<service account token> \
  kubernetes_host="https://kubernetes.default.svc:443" \
  kubernetes_ca_cert=<kubernetes ca cert>
```

Besides checking that the service account token has been correctly signed, 
Vault uses the Kubernetes API to validate that the presented service account token 
is valid.  For this reason the `kubernetes_host` and `kubernetes_ca_cert` are required
when configuring the Kubernetes authentication method.
