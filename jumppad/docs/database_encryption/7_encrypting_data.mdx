# Encrypting data on save

Now let's add a method that will encrypt the card number before saving it to the database. 

The VaultTemplate class provides a method called `opsForTransit` that allows you to interact with the Transit Secrets Engine. You can use this method to encrypt and decrypt data. The method requires a single parameter that is the path to the Transit Secrets Engine. The reason you need to specify the path is that Vault allows you to multiple Transit Secrets Engines
mounted at different paths.

```java
VaultTransitOperations transitOperations = vault.opsForTransit("transit");
```

Once you have an instance of the `VaultTransitOperations` class you can use the `encrypt` method to encrypt the data. The `encrypt` method requires two parameters, the first is the name of the encryption key and the second is the plaintext data that you want to encrypt.

```java
Ciphertext ciphertext = transitOperations.encrypt("payments", Plaintext.of(ref.getNumber()));
```

Finally, you can set the encrypted data on the entity before saving it to the database.

```java
ref.setNumber(ciphertext.getCiphertext());
```

The full method should look like this:

```java
@PrePersist
@PreUpdate
public void encryptDataBeforeSave(final PaymentCard ref) {
  // encrypt the card number
  VaultTransitOperations transitOperations = vault.opsForTransit("transit");
  Ciphertext ciphertext = transitOperations.encrypt("payments", Plaintext.of(ref.getNumber()));

  ref.setNumber(ciphertext.getCiphertext());
}
```

### Add this to your class and we can then wire this up to the entity.

  @PrePersist
  @PreUpdate
  public void encryptDataBeforeSave(final PaymentCard ref) {
    // encrypt the card number
    VaultTransitOperations transitOperations = vault.opsForTransit("transit");
    Ciphertext ciphertext = transitOperations.encrypt("payments", Plaintext.of(ref.getNumber()));

    ref.setNumber(ciphertext.getCiphertext());
  }
}
```

The final step is to wire up the listener to the entity so that the code is executed
before the entity is persisted to the database.
