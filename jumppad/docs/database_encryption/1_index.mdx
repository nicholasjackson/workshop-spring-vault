# Database Encryption

In the last section you learned how to confgiure database credentials using Vault
for your Spring applications. In this section you will learn how to us Vault's 
Transit Secrets Engine to encrypt and decrypt data in your database.

## Enabling the Transit Secrets Engine

All engines and authentication methods must be enabled at a particular path before they can be used. 
This is usually a one-time operation. Let's enable the transit secrets engine

The name of the transit engine is called `transit` like the name of the database
engine was called `database`. Why not have a go at enabling the transit engine.
