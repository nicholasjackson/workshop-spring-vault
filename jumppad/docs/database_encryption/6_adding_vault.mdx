# Injecting the Vault Client

Using Springs dependency injection, you can inject the Vault client into the class. 
Add the following code to the `PaymentCardListener` class.  When an instance of 
this class is created Spring will automatically inject a `VaultTemplate` instance 
into the class. The `VaultTemplate` class is a high-level abstraction for interacting with Vault.

### Add the following code to the class you just created to inject a vault client

```java
@Autowired
private VaultTemplate vault;
```

  @Autowired

}

Next let's add a method that will encrypt the data before an entity is saved.
