# Creating encryption keys

To encrypt and decrypt data using the Transit Secrets Engine, you need to create 
an encryption key. You can create multiple keys for different purposes.
There are also many different types of keys that you can create, such as
AES, RSA, and ECDSA.

Since the keys are managed by Vault it is generally a good idea to create a new key
for each application that needs to encrypt data. This way you can easily rotate the key
without affecting other applications. The keys are securely stored inside of Vault
and unless you explicitly state that you would like to export the key, it is not possible
to retrieve the key.

### Run the following command to create a new RSA 4096 encryption key:

```shell
vault write -f transit/keys/payments type=rsa-4096
```

Next let's see how you can use Vault to encrypt data.
