# Static secrets

Another of Vault and Spring boots capabilities is to enable the automatic
injection of secrets as a property.

When configured, upon startup Spring will attempt to retrieve secrets from the following
paths:

```shell
/secret/{application}/{profile}
/secret/{application}
/secret/{defaultContext}/{profile}
/secret/{defaultContext}
```

The secrets that are stored at that path are automatically read by Spring
and can then be injected using the following convention.

```java
@Value("${key name}")
String password;
```

i.e given a secret exists with the key `password`, you could define the following.

```java
@Value("${password}")
String password;
```

## Enabling the Vault secrets engine

Before you can use the secrets engine you must first mount it, you can find 
the details on how to do this at the following location.

https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2

**HINT** You need to enable the engine at the path `secret` this requires a
specific parameter

### Enable the kv2 engine at the path `secret`

Did that work? If not you can find the soloution below.
