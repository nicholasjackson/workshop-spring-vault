# Testing the application

Now that everything is configured, let's run the application locally and see if it can connect to the database.

Run the following URL to start the application:

```shell
gradle bootRun
```

All being well you will not see any errors and the spring boot application will start.
Let's test the application by inserting a record into the `payments` table.

Run the following command in the terminal:

```shell 
curl localhost:8080/secret
```

You should see the value of the Vault secret returned.

## Summary
This brings us to the end of the workshop, there are many other features in Vault,
if you have a little time, why not try to modify the applicatoin and add some
of the additional features.

### Ideas
* Hash some data
* HMAC a value
* Learn how to version kv secrets
* Generate x509 certificates
* Implement custom revocation statements for database secrets
