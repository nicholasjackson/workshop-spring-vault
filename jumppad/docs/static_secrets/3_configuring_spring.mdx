# Configuring Spring

As you learned at the begining of this section, Spring will attempt to load
secrets from certain default paths. One of those paths is the application name
the secret for which you created in the previous step.

Let's ensure that the spring application has been configured with the correct name.

## Set the application name in the Spring config to `SpringVaultApplication`

Manage that? If not the solution is below.

<p>
<details>
  <summary style=\{{ fontSize: '18px', color: 'rgb(84, 128, 178)', fontWeight: 'medium' }} >Solution: application name</summary>

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: SpringVaultApplication
```

</details>
</p>

## Enabling the kv settings

If you look at the configuration you will see that the kv is currently disabled

```yaml
  kv:
    enabled: false
```

To inject secrets you need to set this value to `true` so that Spring will attempt
to read the static secret at startup time.

### Set the enabled property to `true`

If you need a hint you can find the solution below.

<p>
<details>
  <summary style=\{{ fontSize: '18px', color: 'rgb(84, 128, 178)', fontWeight: 'medium' }} >Solution: enabling secrets</summary>

```yaml
  kv:
    enabled: false
```

</details>
</p>

Let's now create a new controller to see how you can use these secrets.
